## ECSG

Machine learning offers a promising avenue for expediting the discovery of new compounds by accurately predicting their thermodynamic stability. This approach provides significant advantages in terms of time and resource efficiency compared to traditional experimental and modeling methods. However, most existing models are constructed based on specific domain knowledge, potentially introducing biases that impact their performance. 

To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel machine learning framework **Electron Configuration Stacked Generalization (ECSG)**(https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55525-y), rooted in electron configuration, further enhanced through stack generalization with two additional models grounded in diverse domain knowledge. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our model in accurately predicting the stability of compounds, achieving an impressive Area Under the Curve (AUC) score of 0.988. Notably, our model demonstrates exceptional efficiency in sample utilization, requiring only one-seventh of the data used by existing models to achieve the same performance.

## Demo data

You can train a demo model by:

```shell
python train.py --name demo --path data/datasets/demo_mp_data.csv --epochs 10
```

If the following files exist in the **models** directory, it means the program runs successfully: 
```text
models
├── demo_meta_model.pkl
├── Roost_demo_0
├── Roost_demo_1
├── Roost_demo_2
├── Roost_demo_3
├── Roost_demo_4
├── ECCNN_demo_0.pth
├── ECCNN_demo_1.pth
├── ECCNN_demo_2.pth
├── ECCNN_demo_3.pth
├── ECCNN_demo_4.pth
├── Magpie_demo_0.json
├── Magpie_demo_1.json
├── Magpie_demo_2.json
├── Magpie_demo_3.json
├── Magpie_demo_4.json
```
After training the demo, you can predict using composition
```shell
python predict.py --name demo --path data/datasets/demo_mp_data.csv
```


## Input
This project provides two feature processing schemes,  each with different input requirements.
#### 1、Feature Processing at Runtime
In this scheme, users need to provide a CSV file containing the materials-id and composition. The program will process the CSV file and generate features at runtime.

The input CSV file must contain the following columns:

- material-id: Unique identifier for each material.
- composition: Chemical composition of the material.

Example of a valid CSV file:

| material-id | composition | 
|-------------|-------------|
| 1           | Fe2O3       | 
| 2           | Al2O3       | 
| ...         | ...         | 


#### 2、Load Preprocessed Feature File
Given the large datasets, feature construction can be quite time-consuming. Additionally, the training process involves cross-validation, which can further increase the computation time.
Therefore, we provide a solution that can load features locally to save time.

You can extract features once and save them using `feature.py`. Run the following command to save the features:
```shell
python feature.py --path your_data.csv --feature_path feature_file
```
For more details, please refer to [Usage](#usage).

## Output
The prediction results will be saved in the **results/meta** folder under the filename **f'{name}_predict_results.csv'**, where **{name}** corresponds to the name of your customized model name. The stability prediction results will be in the target column of the CSV file.


## Usage
#### Prediction
To predict the thermodynamic stability of materials, You can download the pre-trained model files from the following link:

[Download Pre-trained Model](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12KcFrYxGNUhQlRy_br0vs98mMsSg-eF0?usp=sharing)

Place all the downloaded model files in the **models** folder in the project root directory.
Use the following command to make predictions. Replace **your_data.csv** with the path to your data file containing the compounds of interest:
```shell
python predict.py --name MP --path your_data.csv
```
or use local feature file:
```shell
python predict.py --name MP --path your_data.csv --load_from_local 1 --feature_path feature_file
```


## Experiment reproduction

#### Reproducibility with training
Run the following command to start training:

```shell
python train.py --name customized_model_name --path data/datasets/MP_all.csv
```
In the **data/datasets** folder, there are [instructions](https://github.com/HaoZou-csu/ECSG/blob/main/data/datasets/readme.md) to download all the datasets in this study. We also provided the processed files, like **MP_all.csv**.Ensure that the model takes **input** in the form CSV files with materials-ids, composition strings and target values as the columns.

| material-id | composition | target |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| 1           | Au1Cu1Tm2   | False  |
| 2           | Eu5F1O12P3  | True   |
| ...         | ...         | ...    |

After training, the training log will be saved in the **log** folder through tensorboard, the files containing models' structures and learned parameters will be saved in the **models** folder and the save folder, and the test results will be printed out and saved in **results** folder.

#### Reproducibility with trained models
[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12KcFrYxGNUhQlRy_br0vs98mMsSg-eF0?usp=sharing) and copy all of the files in **MP** folder into the root directory of the **models** folder.
```shell
python train.py --name MP --train 0 --path data/datasets/MP_all.csv
```

If set `performance_test=True` and a test dataset is defined, the performance of the model will be printed as follows:

## Prediction with structure information
To further improve prediction accuracy, we provide modules that include structural information in ECSGs when the structure is known. Follow the steps:
#### 1. Specify the CIF Files Folder
You need to provide a folder containing the CIF files for the materials you want to predict. In this folder, there must also be an **id_prop.csv** file and an **atom_init.json** file. **id_prop.csv** should include a column that lists the IDs of the CIF files to be used for prediction. We have provided an example in the **data/datsets/mp_2024_demo/cif** folder. **atom_init.json** contains the necessary information for the atom embedding and we provided this file in **data/datasets/mp_2024_demo/cif** folder.
#### 2. Download and Place Pre-trained Models
[Download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12KcFrYxGNUhQlRy_br0vs98mMsSg-eF0?usp=sharing) the pre-trained models and place them in the models folder. Copy all of the files in **MP_cif_train_1** folder and  **CGCNN** folder into the root directory of the **models** folder. This ensures that the required model files are available for running predictions.
#### 3. Running the Prediction Script
Use the following command to run the prediction script:
```shell
python predict_with_cifs.py --name MP_cif_train_1 --cif_path <path_to_cif_folder> --cgcnn_model_path models
```
**Example**
```shell
python predict_with_cifs.py --name MP_cif_train_1 --cif_path data/datasets/mp_2024_demo/cif --cgcnn_model_path models
```

Please type `predict_with_cifs.py --h` for more help.

```shell
usage: predict_with_cifs.py [-h] [--name NAME] [--cif_path CIF_PATH] [--cgcnn_model_path CGCNN_MODEL_PATH] [--batchsize BATCHSIZE] [--device DEVICE]
